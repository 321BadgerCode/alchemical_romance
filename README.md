**Inspired by 16th-century alchemical manuscripts**, this project algorithmically synthesizes entirely new cryptic symbols using combinations of base-metal glyphs and planetary ideographs. These symbols are visually fused using a neural network-based autoencoder architecture, resulting in intricate, pseudo-esoteric diagrams suitable for art, procedural generation, magical realism, or occult-inspired games.

## ðŸ§ª Project Overview

This project takes as input a set of **Unicode-based alchemical and planetary symbols**, and processes them through a trained **autoencoder neural network**. Rather than simply displaying the glyphs side-by-side, the model **merges and entangles the pixel representations** into a **single new visual archetype**.

The final symbol:

- Is generated **from a neural latent space**.
- **Does not reveal the input glyphs clearly** â€” they are visually transformed and encoded in complex, nonlinear ways.
- Is **deterministically trained** but **non-deterministically decoded**, allowing for **infinite variety** of outputs from the same inputs via **latent noise injection**.
